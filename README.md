## Furthurmore
I get an email from Headhunt say this assigment was 7 days.
So I'm planning to do it with in 7days until I see the expectation just 1 - 1.5 hours !
Well, I don't know how to change, cause I have read the requirememt few days.
So I keep to do my assignment with my plan and you can see the time in git history.
Totally my time spent for it about 4 or 5 hours ! May be it too much. but It my tried after change plan form 7days.
So sorry if it inconvinience, and hope you can check my code and give me a feedback!
Thanks so much!
